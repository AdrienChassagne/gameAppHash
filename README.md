# gameAppHash

Plateformer engine from scratch(already playable).
Made with angularJS and canvas (i know angular is not designed to make games, but that's the challenge)
Homemade basic pixel art.
You can build your maps (tileset)
I chose spatial hashing for collisions (i've tried quadtree but i think spatial hashing is better for platformers).

ToDos: 

-Better drawing service 
-Finish ennemies AI and ennemies POOL
-Finish design/pixel art
-More tiles properties, more ennemies, ect.
