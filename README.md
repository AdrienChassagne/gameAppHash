# gameAppHash

Plateformer engine from scratch(already playable). <br/>
Made with angularJS and canvas (i know angular is not designed to make games, but that's the challenge) <br/>
Homemade basic pixel art. <br/>
You can build your maps (tileset) <br/>
I chose spatial hashing for collisions, i've tried quadtree but i think spatial hashing is better for platformers. <br/>

ToDos: 

-Better drawing service  <br/>
-Finish ennemies AI and ennemies POOL <br/>
-Finish design/pixel art <br/>
-More tiles properties, more ennemies, ect <br/>
